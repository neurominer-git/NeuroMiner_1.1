Once again Prof. Nikolaos Koutsouleris and his team, together with the ECNP Neuroimaging Network, are organizing the Online Machine Learning School that aims to introduce participants  to machine learning with a focus on psychiatric neuroimaging. We have successfully run the highly-rated school over the past few years and it has been very well attended by people across Europe, the US, Africa and Asia. This year, the machine learning school will be held **September 25-29, 2023**. 


## Registration  
People with all levels of machine learning experience are encouraged to apply because you do not need coding experience to implement the cutting-edge machine learning techniques we teach. The course is specifically designed for clinician scientists, PhD students and early career researchers.
