Once again Prof. Nikolaos Koutsouleris and colleagues around the globe, together with the ECNP Neuroimaging Network, are organizing the Online Machine Learning School that aims to introduce participants  to machine learning with a focus on psychiatric neuroimaging. We have successfully run the highly-rated school over the past few years and it has been very well attended by people across Europe, the US, Africa and Asia. This year, the machine learning school will be held **September 25-29, 2023**. 

This year, we have expanded to offer an Asia-Pacific school in order to accommodate the growing interest in Machine Learning and people who cannot attend the European school due to time differences between the continents!


## Registration  
People with all levels of machine learning experience are encouraged to apply because you do not need coding experience to implement the cutting-edge machine learning techniques we teach. The course is specifically designed for clinician scientists, PhD students and early career researchers.

:::{admonition} Central European Time 
:class: tip
If you are interested in our program but are unable to attend due to the time difference, there is also a parallel event offered by colleagues in Munich and London. For more information and tickets, visit [Online Machine Learning School - Central European](0.1_MLSchool).

```


```{dropdown} What is the difference between the European and Asia-Pacific schools?

```

```{dropdown} Are there any differences between the European and Asia-Pacific schools?
The European and Asia-Pacific schools each have their own panel of expert guest speakers from the Machine Learning field. However, regardless of if you are attending the European or Asia-Pacific school, you will have access to ALL lectures and seminars, as these sessions will be recorded and shared.
```


```{dropdown} What is NeuroMiner?
Neurominer is a free software developed to facilitate research into better tools for precision medicine, able to perform multiple kinds of Machine Learning analyses. Neurominer requires no coding experience.
```

```{dropdown} How do I download NeuroMiner?
Matlab R2023a is required in order to run Neurominer. A free 30-day trial can be downloaded from the MathWorks website. Neurominer can be downloaded from https://github.com/neurominer-git. Please ensure you download the latest version.
