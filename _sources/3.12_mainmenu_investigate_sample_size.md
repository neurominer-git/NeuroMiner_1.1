# Investigate sample size (simulation)
NeuroMiner allows you to estimate the performance of models trained with simulated data. This can give you an idea of how big of a sample you need for your research question.

Another feature of the simulation tool within NeuroMiner is that you can compare the performance of a model trained on real data with the same model trained on more (or less) simulated data, or on the original, real dataset enriched with more simulated data (either equally distributed over the dataset or group specific).
