### Load training template {#3.2.09_load_training_template}

When a parameter template has been saved in the previous menu item, it
can be loaded with this feature. This will parametise all settings
within the template of the new NM structure, and thus will allow it to
be initialised in the next step.

Please note that you will see a menu item warning about the
cross-validation set-up. This warning is to highlight the fact that if
you have different data then you need to re-create the cross-validation
structure.
