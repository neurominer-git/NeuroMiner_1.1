Suggested Prerequisites
=======================

NeuroMiner works exclusively from the MATLAB command line, there are
some situations in which the variables need to be in a specific format
in order for NeuroMiner to recognise them, as described later in this
manual. You may also want to understand the NeuroMiner outputs stored in
output variables. For these reasons, we recommend a minimal level of
knowledge about command-line operation of MATLAB (see below).

MATLAB:

-   Know the differences between vectors/matrices/cell-arrays/structures

-   Know how to address certain cells/rows/columns of the variables

-   Know how to delete/create/address items in a MATLAB structure

-   Know the differences between numerical/string/binary variables

-   Know how to add stuff to the MATLAB path and why this is needed

-   Know how to import files into MATLAB

NeuroMiner is a program that uses a number of advanced machine learning
tools. We have provided some description of the most important concepts
and techniques, but the manual often assumes machine learning knowledge.
For this reason, we recommend a basic understanding of machine learning
concepts (see below).

Machine learning:

-   What is the difference between training and test samples?

-   What is crossvalidation/nested cross-validation?

-   What is preprocessing (for machine learning, not just MRI data)?

-   What are filters and wrappers?

-   What are features and classification targets?

-   What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?

-   What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM)?
