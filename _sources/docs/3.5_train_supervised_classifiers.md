Train supervised classifiers {#3.5_train_supervised_classifiers}
----------------------------

As depicted in Figure
[\[fig:nm_flowchart\]](#fig:nm_flowchart){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:nm_flowchart"}, once the parameter template has been
completed and initialized there is the option to train the models. This
implies the use of a statistical technique, such as an SVM, along with
the hyperparameter optimisation (e.g., optimising the C parameter) and
any wrappers that might have been activated. The following menu will be
displayed:

1: Create analysis from scratch\
2: Create analysis using precomputer preprocdata-MATs\
3: Create analysis using precomputed CVdatamats\
4: Create analysis using precomputed CVresult-MATs

**1: Create analysis from scratch**\
This is where the analysis has only been initialized and no data
matrices have been stored. This will preprocess and then train
classifiers. Please note, that if your matrices are large (e.g., with
neuroimaging data) then this will take up a lot of RAM and as such it is
recommended to preprocess the data first.

**2: Create analysis using precomputer preprocdata-MATs**\
This is when the user has preprocessed their data and stored the
preprocessed files in a folder; i.e., they have TRAIN files.

**3: Create analysis using precomputed CVdatamats**\
This is when the user has completed an analysis (preprocessing and
training) and they have the data matrix files stored in a folder; i.e.,
\"\...CVdatamat_oCV\...\" files. When this option is selected, the
analysis results from the CVdatamat files are then collated into a
result file. It is useful especially when the program has crashed,
and/or the NM structure has not been saved, and the user wants to get
the results without re-running all the training again.

**4: Create analysis using precomputed CVresult-MATs**\
This is when the user already has the results file and they want to
integrate the results into the NM structure. This is useful if there has
been a crash and the data has been lost from the NM structure.
