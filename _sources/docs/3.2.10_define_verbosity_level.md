### Define verbosity level {#3.2.10_define_verbosity_level}

During preprocessing, this option will either output all processing
steps being performed on the data using the \"detailed\" setting
(recommended for first time use and to check processes) or you can set
it so that it only outputs the training fold that it's working on and
nothing else (the \"none\" setting). Setting this to \"none\" will
increase the speed of analysis because it will not have to print the
steps to screen.
