Preprocess features {#3.4_preprocess_features}
-------------------

Once the data has been initialized, the user has the option to
preprocess the features. In NeuroMiner nomenclature, this refers to any
steps that are conducted within the cross-validation folds prior to
training a model. For example, the data within each fold could be scaled
and then imputed, or a principal components analysis could be conducted.

When this option is selected, the user will be presented with the
following:

1 : Select analysis to operate on \[Analysis 1\]\
2 : Overwrite existing preprocessed data files \[ no \]\
3 : Use existing preprocessing parameter files, if available \[ no \]\
4 : Write out computed parameters to disk (may require A LOT of disk
space) \[ no \]\
5 : Select CV2 partitions to operate on \[ 0 selected \]

**2: Overwrite existing preprocessed data files**. NeuroMiner will save
preprocessed data files and selecting this option will overwrite them.

**3: Use existing preprocessing parameter files, if available**. The
user has the option to save parameter files (e.g., betas from regression
of age from a feature) and this option will allow them to use the
existing files.

**4: Write out computer parameters to disk**. This option will write the
parameters (e.g., beta coefficients) to disk. This is not recommended
due to space limitations.

**5: Select CV2 partition to operate on**. This option will only appear
if an analysis has been selected in step 1. It allows the user to select
the folds that the preprocessing analysis will be applied to (see Box:
Selecting CV folds in NeuroMiner).
