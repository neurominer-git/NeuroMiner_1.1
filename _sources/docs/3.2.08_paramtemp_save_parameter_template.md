# Save parameter template

<!-- Once the parameters are defined in the above steps, they will be
included within the \"NM\" MATLAB structure and will be ready to be
\"initialised\" in the previous menu. However, the user also has the
option here of saving the parameter settings into a separate .mat file
so that they could re-load them for another analysis. This allows the
user to be certain that the same parameters are applied in analyses with
different data.

Please note when saving that loading parameter templates from different
versions of NeuroMiner is currently unsupported. -->
