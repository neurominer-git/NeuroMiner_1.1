# Known Issues

- App Designer doesn't work with MATlAB older than R2021b

- Python connection only works with more recent Matlab


<!-- NeuroMiner is currently undergoing testing and there are a number of
known issues that require further work. These are the following.

-   The results of external validation analyses are not displayed and
    need to be accessed in the NM structure;

-   External validation analysis currently uses a lot of RAM for high
    dimensional matrices;

-   External validation does not work when using stacking;

-   If training is run without preprocessing then it can use a lot of
    RAM for high dimensional matrices;

-   Random forest algorithm is not included in precompiled Linux
    versions and needs to be compiled;

-   There is currently no facility to visualise surface-based (e.g.,
    mgz) results and it is recommended that this is achieved manually;

-   GLMNET is unstable under Windows 7

-   The database import does not work with Linux odt files. Please
    convert to xls.

-   The extraction of scores (e.g., decision scores) in the results
    viewer does not function using Linux -->
