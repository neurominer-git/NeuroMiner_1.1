## Correct usage notes

### One-class support vector machine (classification)
To correctly use the one-class SVM (within the [LIBSVM package](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)), the reference group needs to be labeled as -1 or 2. One class classifciation is currently still in development, thus, error might arise. Please send an email to the developers should you encounter some bugs. 

### Default parameters of matLearn algorithms 
Some of the algoirthmy form the matLearn package currently come with no default parameters set. Make sure to choose these before initializing and running a model to avoid issues and errors. You can set the parameters when navigating to the **Learning algorithm parameters** ([more information](learning_algorithm_parameters)) option from the Parameter Template menu. To get an overview of the parameters and what values they can take, have a look at the [matLearn documentation](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/matLearn.html).
